How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure the functionality of my code by using in line tests as I go, and then when I feel my code meets the requirements for the
product I write tests based upon those requirements. I approach testing by first writing tests that represent an ideal path through
the product, ensuring that if the user behaves as expected that the proper reactions are taken by the system. After all of those
tests are written and the expected path is covered I work back through testing for edge cases and unexpected user interactions. I 
am always making sure that unexpected inputs are not breaking the system. Once my tests are written and all passing I reviewed the 
test coverage report, aiming for as high of a percentage of coverage as possible. With this project I was able to hit 99% coverage.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are the basis of my workflow, especially for projects like this where you are starting from scratch. The requirements 
are the building blocks of the entire project. For this project specifically I appreciated that we were given the requirements
and left to decide how to approach and write them ourselves. Not only do the user needs drive the development of the product, but
as previously described they also are the basis of my software tests as well. Keeping the user in mind throughout the entire SDLC
is necessary for keeping people happy and supplying what was requested.

How do I approach designing software?
I think I approach designing software by first reading and understanding the user requirements. In a real life scenario this would
mean open communication with stakeholders, to ensure there was a full understanding on both sides before fully getting started
on a project. From there I let the requirements drive the design, trying to find the most ideal way to build out the code to 
provide the desired experience, while maintaining a secure and functional system. For me this process definitely entails some trial
and error. Often my first approach to implementing functionality is not the one I stick with because I find a better was to write 
it, or the way I initially wrote it doesn't fit well with code I wrote later on. To summarize my approach, I keep requirements at 
the center of my design and build out from there.
